  <h1>Marika Jasinski's Portfolio</h1>
  <h2>Senior Year Student at the Illinois Institute of Technology</h2>
  <h3>Information Technology and Management Major</h3>
  <p>After more than a decade of searching for the perfect career field, I finally
    feel like I am right where I belong. I have gone through many diverse programs, from
    veterinary medicine to electrical engineering. I chose the ITM program at IIT
    because both my mother and father graduated from there, and
    the school offered me a generous scholarship package.
  <br>It seems like I fell into the right spot because all the classes are interesting and engaging.
    Plus, I have learned more about networking and computers in two years here than I have ever before
    in my life.
  <br>I am ready to graduate with a solid toolbox of skills and to start my IT career at a successful tech company.
     Please take a moment to view my Resume and Projects page to see all the interesting activities that I have been a part of
    here at IIT.
  <br>Thanks!</p>
